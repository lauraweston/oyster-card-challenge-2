# Oystercard Challenge

This challenge will start with going back over the basics we covered last week in Boris Bikes, giving you the chance to reinforce what you learned last week. You'll then be challenged to build a more complex system which should really stretch your skills in Code Design, Ruby, RSpec and Object-Oriented Programming.
